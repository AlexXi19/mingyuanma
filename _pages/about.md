<!-- My name is Mingyuan Ma, ML Expert. I love Jennifer!     # <p>mamingyuan2001@berkeley.edu</p>
    # <p>Berkeley, CA</p> -->
I spent my four years undergraduate life at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), with degree in Statistics and in Computer Science. In August, 2023, I start my new journey at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) to study Data Science (SM).

At Berkeley, I work with [Prof. Park Sinchaisri](https://parksinchaisri.github.io) from Operations and Information Technology Management group of Haas School of Business, and our research project is the Human-AI collaboration. Besides, I work closely with [Presidential Young Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) and [Ph.D. Zangwei Zheng](https://zhengzangw.github.io) at [HPC-AI Lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg), National University of Singapore. 

My current research interest is related to **Efficient Deep Learning**, using less resources to train our models while keeping or imporving performance. From Data perspective, I am interested in **Continual Learning**, **Few-Shot Learning**.  From Algorithm perspective, I am interested in **Efficient Training** and **Model Compression**.
